Currently I keep a link in the city of Manaus, in the heart of the Amazon rainforest. This link is connected to the Amazon Conference in Echolink (* AMAZON *). Very well discussed on renewable energy and energy saving. then found the Raspberry Pi. My link is working on Raspberry Pi B + (PU8ASR-L) In Brazil, unfortunately there are few knowledgeable / Linux system users and even less those who use and maintain a link with the amateur radio. I think I have given you to understand the purpose of this repository. I want to create a repository here so from a single command line, any user can start a guided and automatic installation, where the user must inform few data such as INDICATIVE, PASSWORD and model of your Raspberry / OS and from the then the system / scripts start the process of autoinstalar and autoconfigure all, leaving only the user to perform the necessary connections and use the link. It seems strange to do something in parallel to svxlink of sm0svx. We do not compete and I congratulate the hobby colleague for the efforts. I want to give a contribution does not change its structure and maybe later we can merge all, will be a mutual benefit (to all). We can even insert interfaces schemes in this repository and equivamente scheme will be downloaded according to user choice. If this project aroused interest in you, come in and help popularize the Raspberry and SVXLINK.\r\n\r\nObjective 1: Allow from a command line user can perform the download of an initial file called svxlink-automake and run this file to launch a wizard using the Linux shell and this assistant store in variable values ​​for code, password Model Raspberry and version SVXLINK that it wishes to install. Example command: wget http://www.amazon.qsl.br/downloads/svxlink-automake && ./svxlink-automake\r\n\r\nI believe so we can popularize this technology and reduce costs to keep a link on the air 24 hours a day.",
